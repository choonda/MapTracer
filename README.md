📖 Overview
MapTracer is an AI-driven productivity tool that transforms boring study plans into immersive RPG-style "Games." Most AI tutors focus on teaching content; we focus on accountability and execution.

Users don't just "study for a test"—they embark on a campaign. By defining your goals and timeline, our AI generates a visual roadmap (The Skill Tree) where every task is a quest and every milestone is a boss fight.

✨ Key Features
The AI Guild Master (Chatbot): Input your learning goal, current level, and deadline. Our AI parses this data to build a custom, time-bound "Game Map."

The Skill Tree (Roadmap): A non-linear visual representation of your learning path. Nodes unlock as you complete tasks.

The Vault (Game Storage): Manage multiple "Games" (e.g., The Python Sorcerer and The French Diplomat) simultaneously with distinct progress tracking.

Proof of Work Tracking: We don't teach; we verify. Users provide references or evidence of work to "Level Up" their character.

Nudge System: Instead of generic notifications, receive lore-based reminders to keep your streak alive.;

🗺️ How it Works
Initiate Quest: Tell the AI what you want to learn (e.g., "Master React in 30 days").

Generate Map: The AI outputs a JSON-structured roadmap, which the UI renders as a game map.

Level Up: Complete real-world tasks. Use the provided references to study.

Stay Accountable: The system tracks your pace. If you fall behind, your "Health" drops; if you stay on track, you earn "Legendary" status.
